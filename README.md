## Introduction

The focus of this project is **building a Sinatra API backend** that uses
**Active Record** to access and persist data in a database, which will be used
by a separate **React frontend** (https://github.com/JamesKibathi/ShoppingList-App-GRP4-Frontend) that interacts with the database via the API.

## Tecchnologies used
* Ruby
* Sinatra API
* Rack Server
* Active Records ORM
* SQL
